Database schema
Building a database schema is the first step in database design. It is essential especially when you are dealing with relational databases because you want a solid structure for your database before you can move forward. A database schema is like a blueprint of how data in a database will look and be stored.

A schema consists of what’s known as schema objects. Schema objects could be things like tables, columns and relationships, at a minimum. Data types, views, stored procedures, primary keys and foreign keys are also schema objects.

Basically, a database schema consists of:

all the important data pertaining to a given scenario and their relationships,

unique keys for all entries and database objects,

and a name and data type for each column in a table.



    CREATE TABLE tbl(

    table_id INT,

    location VARCHAR(255),

    PRIMARY KEY (table_id)

);


CREATE TABLE waiter(

    waiter_id INT,

    name VARCHAR(150),

    contact_no VARCHAR(10),

    shift VARCHAR(10),

    PRIMARY KEY (waiter_id)

);

CREATE TABLE table_order(

    order_id INT,

    date_time DATETIME,

    table_id INT,

    waiter_id INT,

    PRIMARY KEY (order_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (table_id) REFERENCES tbl(table_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (waiter_id) REFERENCES waiter(waiter_id)

);

CREATE TABLE customer(

    customer_id INT,

    name VARCHAR(100),

    NIC_no VARCHAR(12),

    contact_no VARCHAR(10),

    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)

);

CREATE TABLE reservation(

    reservation_id INT,

    date_time DATETIME,

    no_of_pax INT,

    order_id INT,

    table_id INT,

    customer_id INT,

    PRIMARY KEY (reservation_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES table_order(table_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (table_id) REFERENCES tbl(table_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)

);


CREATE TABLE menu(

    menu_id INT,

    description VARCHAR(255),

    availability INT,

    PRIMARY KEY (menu_id)

);



CREATE TABLE menu_item(

    menu_item_id INT,

    description VARCHAR(255),

    price FLOAT,

    availability INT,

    menu_id INT,

    PRIMARY KEY (menu_item_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (menu_id) REFERENCES menu(menu_id)

);



CREATE TABLE order_menu_item(

    order_id INT,

    menu_item_id INT,

    quantity INT,

    PRIMARY KEY (order_id,menu_item_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES table_order(order_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (menu_item_id) REFERENCES menu_item(menu_item_id)

);


What is the relational model?
The relational model is built around three main concepts which are:

Data,

Relationships,

and constraints.

It describes a database as “a collection of inter-related relations (or tables)”.
It is still a dominant model used for data storage and retrieval.
In essence, it is a way of organizing or storing data in a database.
SQL is the language that’s used to retrieve data from a relational database.
