The DISTINCT keyword:

Using SELECT DISTINCT on a single column:

SELECT BillingCountry
FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry;

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry;


Using SELECT DISTINCT on multiple columns:

SELECT BillingCountry, BillingCity
FROM invoices;


SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry, BillingCity
FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry, BillingCity;


NULL values in a DISTINCT column:


SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry, BillingCity
FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry, BillingCity;

Using DISTINCT with SQL aggregate functions:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
FROM customers;
